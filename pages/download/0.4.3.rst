* Linux/Unix/OSX: ``bin/run``
* Windows: ``bin/run.bat``
* OSX: open the app archive

**Mac users** using the app archive need to tell ADAMS where to find the
example flows (see above for download). The **Placeholders.props** file needs to be
`downloaded <https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/resources/Placeholders.props>`_ to
``$HOME/.adams`` and the ``EXAMPLE_FLOWS`` directory in the props file
pointed to the actual directory with the example flows.
