Obtaining the source code
=========================

The ADAMS source code is hosted in the following github repository:

`https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-base <base_>`_

You can check out the code ("trunk") in the console with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-base.git


Other modules
-------------

Further modules are available:

* **addons** (less common used):

  `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-addons <addons_>`_

* **spectral-base** (spectral data processing):

  `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-spectral-base <spectral-base_>`_

* **applications** (domain-specific applications):

  `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-applications <applications_>`_

* **libraries** (module-specific additional libraries):

  `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-libraries <libraries_>`_


Compiling the source code
=========================

ADAMS uses Maven_ as build tool. See the Requirements section for more details
on what you need for compiling the code.

Download the settings.xml_ file and place it in the following directory (if you
are behind a proxy, see section Proxy_ below):

* Linux/Unix/Mac: 

  ``$HOME/.m2``

* Windows: 

  ``%USERPROFILE%\.m2``

You need to set the environment variable ``JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`` to
``-Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false`` to avoid the ``Server SSL Error - handshake
alert: unrecognized_name`` error message.

Also recommended, is adding the following parameter to the ``JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`` in
order to always get a full strack traces whenever an error occurs:
``-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow``

You can compile the source code in the console as follows:

.. code:: bash

   mvn clean install

If you want to skip the tests, use the following:

.. code:: bash

   mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

This will generate a ZIP archive in the target directory of the adams-base-all
module that contains all the jars and scripts to start ADAMS and the generated
documentation.


LaTeX
=====

If your LaTeX binaries (e.g., ``pdflatex``) aren't on the system's path, you
need to modify the ``latex.binariesPath`` property of the ``latex`` profile in
the ``settings.xml`` file. For instance, if your LaTeX binaries are located in:

.. code:: bat

   C:\texlive\2016\bin\win32

Then adapt the ``latex.binariesPath`` as follows:

.. code:: xml

   <latex.binariesPath>C:/texlive/2016/bin/win32/</latex.binariesPath>



Proxy
=====

If you are behind a proxy, you need to tell Maven about it. Let's assume that
your proxy is called ``proxy.blah.com`` and its port 3128.

If you don't need a password to connect to it, you can add the following tag to
your ``settings.xml`` file:

.. code:: xml

   <proxy>
     <active>true</active>
     <protocol>http</protocol>
     <host>proxy.blah.com</host>
     <port>3128</port>
     <nonProxyHosts>localhost|*.blah.com</nonProxyHosts>
   </proxy>

If your proxy requires a user/password, then you have to **1)** generate a master
password with Maven (which gets stored in your home directory's
``.m2/settings-security.xml`` file) and then **2)** the actual password for the
proxy. The details are explained `here <encryption_>`_ on the Maven
homepage. Once you've created the passwords, you have to add the following
tag to your ``settings.xml`` file and replace the ``USER`` and
``ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD`` placeholders accordingly.

.. code:: xml

   <proxy>
     <active>true</active>
     <protocol>http</protocol>
     <host>proxy.blah.com</host>
     <port>3128</port>
     <username>USER</username>
     <password>{ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD}</password>
     <nonProxyHosts>localhost|*.blah.com</nonProxyHosts>
   </proxy>
