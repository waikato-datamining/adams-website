Installation
============

ADAMS only requires very minimal setup:

* You need `Java 11 (JDK) or later <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/>`__ (if you don't have admin rights on Windows,
  please see `this blog post <link://slug/windows-no-admin-no-problem>`__ to get set up).
* Download either a `release <link://slug/release>`__ (less frequently updated) or a
  `snapshot <link://slug/snapshot>`__ (daily builds from latest code).
* Simply decompress the zip archive of ADAMS that you downloaded and launch ADAMS via the `bin\start_gui.bat` batch file or
  `bin/start_gui.sh` shell script. Linux users that downloaded either the `.deb` or `.rpm` package, install it with
  your distro's package manager and you should find shortcut in your start menu.


First steps
===========

Check out the manual ``adams-core-manual.pdf`` that comes with ADAMS:

*Using ADAMS ▶ Flows ▶ Creating flows*

This section discusses how to create your first *Hello World!* flows.

The first part of the manual, *Using ADAMS*, covers most of the core
functionality of ADAMS, like control actors, variables, storage, debugging,
etc.


Prototyping
===========

ADAMS strives to enable you to quickly set up and modify complex workflows,
allowing you to concentrate on the functionality rather than the
presentation.

Drag'n'drop of actors
---------------------

Using drag'n'drop you can quickly assemble a flow:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/dragndrop-example1.png

Dragging the *StringConstants* source onto the flow.

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/dragndrop-example2.png

Specifying how to insert the *StringConstants* source into the flow.


Context-sensitive adding of actors
----------------------------------

Instead of adding actors by dragging them from the library of available ones,
you can use ADAMS' context-awareness when adding actors via right-clicking on
an actor and adding it *beneath*, *here* or *after*:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-combobox.png

On the left-hand side, you always see the complete range of possible actors.
You can also search within the (class) names of the actors. While typing the
search string, the view gets updated and only the actors that match the
search string are being displayed.

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-search.png

For now we settle on using the *FileSupplier* actor as source. Adding an
additional actor after the FileSupplier will remove the source actors from the
class tree and also change the suggested actors to add next:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-context1.png

After adding the *WekaFileReader* we get presented with another list of
suggested actors:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-context2.png

With the dataset fully configured, the *WekaCrossValidationEvaluator* actor is
the next one that we want to choose from the suggestions:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-context3.png

To obtain a summary of the cross-validation performed, we will add the
*WekaEvaluationSummary* transformer which will generate textual output:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-context4.png

And finally, we add the *Display* sink for viewing the result of the
cross-validation:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-context5.png

Before the flow can be executed, we still need to provide the cross-validation
evaluator with a classifier setup. This is done by configuring a *callable
source* actor below the special *CallableActors* standalone:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-context6.png

The *WekaClassifierSetup* source simply outputs a classifier setup:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/actorsuggestions-context7.png


Command-line execution
======================

Though the flow editor is mainly used for designing and executing flows, you
are by no means restricted to it. ADAMS was designed from the start to be
executed in a server/headless environment, i.e., through command-line invocation. The
following command-lines are using the *bash* shell. Windows users need to change
*exec.sh* to *exec.bat* and *forward slashes* to *backslashes*.

The class responsible to executing flows from the command-line is:

``adams.flow.FlowRunner``

You can use the launcher (used in the *run* and *run.bat* scripts) to execute a
flow as follows:

``./bin/exec.sh -main adams.flow.FlowRunner -input /path/to/your.flow``

If the default memory allocation is now enough or too much, use the ``-memory``
option to define the `heap size
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine#Heap>`_ explicitly, e.g.,
256 MB:

``./bin/exec.sh -main adams.flow.FlowRunner -memory 256m -input /path/to/your.flow``

The following options are specific to the ``FlowRunner`` class:

* ``-clean-up`` - automatically closes any windows after the flow finishes
  execution and returns control back to command shell
* ``-headless`` - suppresses all graphical output, useful in server
  environment/background process

This command-line executes a flow that performs a 10-fold cross-validation and instead of showing the result in a Display actor, it simply outputs it in the console:

``./bin/exec.sh -main adams.flow.FlowRunner -memory 256m -clean-up -headless -input ./flows/adams-weka-crossvalidate_classifier.flow``

The manual (adams-core-manual.pdf) has more information on how to run flows
via Linux's systemd (section *Linux servers*) or as a Windows service (section
*Windows servers*).


Examples
========

The `Examples <link://slug/users-examples>`_ section contains lots of
illustrated examples, some with video.

The most important source of examples are all the example flows that ship with
ADAMS. The file name consists of the module it originates from, e.g.,
``adams-weka`` for a WEKA related flow, followed by a short description of the
flow itself.
