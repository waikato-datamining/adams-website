Miscellaneous videos of various flows.

**Note:** the videos should only be considered educational, as some of the
concepts in ADAMS have changed over time. E.g., *global* actors are now called
*callable*, since they can appear in different scopes within the flow. Also,
*SingleFileSupplier* and *MultiFileSupplier* got merged into the *FileSupplier*
actor.
