Apart from retiring a bunch of unused modules, upgrading a range of dependencies, 
I've switched the codebase to allow Java 11 syntax. Even though only switching to 11 
for the code, the compiled binaries should work with OpenJDK 17 (the next 
long-term-support version of OpenJDK).

**Fixes**

* The *MemoryMonitor* standalone now stops the monitoring when the flow stops.
* The *ListVariableUsage* actor processor (used by *Find usages* in the Flow editor tree popup)
  now lists boolean options as well.
* *EnterManyValues* now restores time/date/datetime values correctly, the ListSelectionValueDefinition now
  can have multi-selection enabled.
* *adams-imaging:* The *PascalVOCObjectLocationsReader* report reader no longer fails with a 
  NullPointerException if the *segmented* node is not present.
* *adams-weka* and *adams-weka-lts*: The *WekaSpreadSheetToPredictions* transformer now handles
  labels correctly that are only present in the *predicted* column.


**Changes**

* *adams-access:* upgraded jackcess to 4.0.2
* *adams-compress:*

  * upgraded compress-lzf to 1.1
  * upgraded zip4j to 2.11.2
  * upgraded junrar to 7.5.3
  * upgraded xz to 1.9
  * upgraded zstd-jni to 1.5.2-4

* *adams-core:* 

  * Upgraded mysql-connector-java to 5.1.49 to address ``Cannot connect: java.sql.SQLException: Unknown system variable 'query_cache_size'`` error
  * Upgraded jclasslocator to 0.0.22 for speeding up classpath analysis
  * The *CounterInit* standalone and transformer now support initializing strings with a specific value
  * The *Preview browser* now allows *fixing* the preview handler, i.e., it does not get reloaded
    from its .props file with the next file. This is useful when using two or more preview windows
    with different handlers for the same file type/extension.
  * The *HashSet* source now allows the user to specify a conversion for converting the hashset elements
    into custom object types in the spreadsheet (default: string).
  * The Flow editor now records what actor handlers are being used for enclosing other actors to offer
    a *common* shortlist in the new, compact *Enclose* item of the tree popup menu.
  * The *Make conditional* action in the Flow editor now uses ConditionalTrigger/SubProcess/Tee for 
    sources/transformers/sinks that don't have a conditional equivalent.
  * The *Expression* plot post-processor can handle plot containers without X values now.

* *adams-db-mysql8:* Upgraded mysql-connector-java to 8.0.30
* *adams-excel:* 

  * Apache POI dependencies upgraded to 4.1.2
  * The *ExcelSpreadSheetReader* can use names in the sheet range now, also improved the handling
    of cell types (e.g., formulas and errors)
  * The *ExcelSpreadSheetWriter* now allows customizing the formats of time, date and date/time
    cells. Also handles boolean cells now.

* *adams-groovy:* upgraded groovy-all dependency to 3.0.8
* *adams-html:* upgraded jetty-server to 9.4.48.v20220622
* *adams-imaging:* 

  * The *IntersectOverUnionRatio* object overlap scheme can now either use bounding
    boxes or polygons for the IoU calculation.
  * The JAI *Resize* BufferedImage transformer now has a *forcePercentage* option to 
    allow upscaling images.

* *adams-jython:* upgraded jython-standalone to 2.7.3
* *adams-matlab:* The *Mat5SpreadSheetReader* can use names in the sheet range now
* *adams-math*: * The *LOWESS*, *SavitzkyGolay* and *SimpleSavitzkyGolay* plot post-processors can handle 
  plot containers without X values now.
* *adams-ml:* The *ConfusionMatrix* transformer can now enumerate the labels (in case of very long labels)
  and outputs a second spreadsheet with the index/label relation.
* *adams-net:* switched to *com.github.mwiede* fork of *jsch* library
* *adams-odf:* The *ODFSpreadSheetReader* can use names in the sheet range now
* *adams-pdf:* 

  * The *SpreadSheet* PDF proclet allows customizing the table width, horizontal alignment
    and relative column widths.
  * upgraded pdfbox to 2.0.27

* *adams-python:* moved Pyro4 related code into *adams-pyro4* module
* *adams-random:* The transformers *ArrayFolds* and *ArraySubSample* now can turn off creating a 
  deep copy of the elements before transferring them to the target array.
* *adams-rats-django:* updated to work with Django 4.1.x and Python 3.8+
* *adams-rest:* upgraded jackson-databind to 2.13.4 to address CVE-2022-42004
* *adams-rsync:* upgraded rsync4j-windows64 to 3.2.3-10
* *adams-spreadsheet:* 

  * The *SpreadSheetDisplay* sink now allows to hide the column with the row index 
    and use a simple header.
  * The *GnumericSpreadSheetReader* can use names in the sheet range now
  * The *NewSpreadSheet* source now can have the headers supplied via an array, which
    takes precedence over the comma-separated list.

* *adams-webservice:* upgraded Apache CXF to 3.5.3
* *adams-yaml:* Upgraded snakeyaml to 1.32 to address CVE-2022-25857 and CVE-2022-38752


**Additions**

* *adams-core:* 

  * The *ArrayDisplay* sink allows displaying array elements in tabs, horizontally, vertically or in a grid.
  * Added the *MapVariableIterator* for iterating over key/value pairs of a map, storing key/value in
    user-specified variables.
  * Added the *Copy (commandline)* option to the Flow editor popup menu (*Copy...*) to allow pasting
    in the GenericObjectEditor.
  * Added the *StringToCharArray* and *CharArrayToString* conversions.

* *adams-imaging:* 

  * The *Regions* plugin for the *Subimages* buffered image transformer allows the user
    to specify arbitrary rectangles (and their annotations) to be extracted.
  * The *ImageObjectOverlapMatrix* transformer generates a matrix between overlapping annotations
    and predictions, which can be turned into a confusion matrix.
  * Additional (non-JAI) *Resize* BufferedImage transformer added for resizing images.
  * The *MergeOverlaps* image object filter can combine multiple, overlapping objects into a 
    single one.
  * The *MergeOverlaps* overlapping object removal scheme combines overlapping objects rather
    than removing them.
  * The *DetermineOverlappingAreas* transformer computes areas of overlapping objects between 
    annotations and predictions.

* *adams-pdf:* 

  * Added the *FixedText* PDF proclet that allows arbitrary text to be added (and variables
    get expanded automatically) without having to load a file from disk.
  * The *ConfusionMatrix* PDF proclet inserts a confusion matrix with better highlighting of
    the diagonal and (optionally) the other cell values.

* *adams-pyro5:* same as *adams-pyro4*, but uses the pyrolite library for communicating with Pyro5
* *adams-spreadsheet:* 

  * Added the conversions *SpreadSheetToRowArray* and *RowArrayToSpreadSheet* for managing
    a spreadsheet as row array and apply existing array operators.
