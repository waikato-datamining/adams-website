A lot of effort was going on behind the scenes to update or remove dependencies that were 
affected by to the `log4j <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228>`__
vulnerability.

**Fixes**

* The *Preview browser* now has an upper limit (defined in its props file) for how
  many previews will get cached, to avoid unnecessary memory being gobbeled up.
* Leaving files in the GenericObjectEditor now falls back on "." (or the current working directory)
  rather than resulting in a parse error.
* *adams-imaging:* The following plugins of the *RemoveOverlappingImageObjects* transformer
  no longer add duplicate objects to the result under certain circumstances: 
  KeepHighestMetaDataValue, RemoveLargerRectangle, RemoveSmallerRectangle.
* *adams-ml*: The SimpleArffSpreadSheetReader/Writer now correctly quote/unquote attribute names.


**Changes**

* *adams-core* and *adams-maven-plugin*: updated logback-core/logback-classic to 1.2.10 (to address log4j)
* *adams-compress:* upgraded junrar to 7.4.1 to address https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m6cj-93v6-cvr5
* *adams-excel*: removed unused openxml4j dependency to avoid old version of log4j being pulled in
* *adams-imaging:* the *ImageSegmentationAnnotator* now allows the application of filters to the layers (as a whole)
* *adams-rest*: updated jackson-databind from 2.9.8 to 2.9.10.8
* *adams-spectral-3way-core*: upgraded multiway-algorithms to 0.0.9
* *adams-spreadsheet:* added *COLUMN_VALUES* which returns all cell values in verbatim order.
* *adams-video:* removed unused org.openimaj:video-processing dependency as it pulls in old version of log4j
* *adams-weka:* updated Weka to 3.9.6-fork-0.0.1
* *adams-xml:* updated xstream to 1.4.19 to address https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-43859.html


**Additions**

* *adams-imaging:* 

  * The *Size* object finder allows filtering by size (width, height or both) using lower and upper bounds.
  * Added I/O support for the YOLO object annotation format (YoloAnnotationsReportReader, 
    YoloAnnotationsReportWriter) and in the preview browser (YoloAnnotationsHandler).
  * Added the *AddDefaultLabel* object filter, which sets a default label for annotations if
    currently none set (to be used with ImageObjectFilter transformer).
