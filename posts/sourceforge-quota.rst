Since 2012, ADAMS has hosted its release files on Sourceforge.net.

This morning, I had an email from them in my inbox, stating that I need to
remove old release files as the project is way over its 5GB file quota.
To be honest, I was not aware that there was a quota and I also did not see
any news that they will be enforcing such a quota.

Either way, I have removed old release files and the ADAMS website is now
hosting the old releases (i.e., downloads may be slower). To further conserve
space, the Debian (.deb) and Redhat (.rpm) release packages have been retired as well.
But you can still download current .deb/.rpm packages via the daily snapshots.
